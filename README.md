# it8620-lm_sensors

This is an example configuration for reading motherboard sensors that use an ITE 8620E sensor IC. 

I was unable to find a working configuration anywhere else, so I created my own. The values should be correct 
with regards to the voltage. The actual values were found using SpeedFan on Windows and correlating the 
voltages with the inX values that lm_sensors was already detecting.
